# Identifying and Defining
Identifying the need: My new game will create a hands-on experience where they must complete the objective in as little time as possilbe. It is personalised to all genders, teens and young adults, mixing satire with real global issues. My game will improve reaction time and timing by engaging hand eye co-ordination to acheive the goal. There will also be tutorials to explain the the movement and goals, not everything will be revealed to retain a sense of menace, but the tutoial will be kept breif so as not to drain their patience and bore them.

# Requirements Outline:
 Inputs: W,A,S,D and the arrows will be incorporated for basic movements, there may also be special commands such as Shift to grab and Tab to dodge. The mouse click and Cursor will also be used.
 Processing: The Program will check for hits, calculating the position of the player if it is not hit, and update the total Game score accordingly.
 Outputs:The Game will display the player's sprite, score and position, it might also include a pop-up message when an object is encountered.
 Transmission: The amount of obstacles you evade each hold different scores, the smaller ones are faster and award more points, the biger ones with slower speeds, award less points. These will be sent to a live feed as an Output so they can constantly see 
 Storage:These points will be updated to their own high score, to improve themselves. Online Leaderboards, may give unrealistic expectations to  casual players which will make them play the game more, affecting health and vision, therfore you will only see your own scores.
