# PMI List
Sea pollution game?  Overfishing game?  Global Warming game?  Climate change game?  Sea rising game? 
The Need for my game: A fun way for teens and young adults to find out about major Global Issues while also enhancing motor skills and Hand-eye co-ordination.
Problem statement: Young Adults are getting increasingly unknowledgeable about the current Global Circumstances and must be given this information in an intruiging way, while also enhancing basic skills.
My skills: I have a basic knowledge of Unity after making my Spongebob game and have lots of resources at my fingertips, such as Learn.Unity.com and the guidance of my teacher. The culmination of these skills will hopefully amount to a succsess without sacrificing any key features. I will also watch Unity tutorials and watch step-by-step youtube tutorials.

# Identifying and Defining
Identifying the need: My new game will create a hands-on experience where they must complete the objective in as little time as possilbe. It is personalised to all genders, teens and young adults, mixing satire with real global issues. My game will improve reaction time and timing by engaging hand eye co-ordination to acheive the goal. There will also be tutorials to explain the the movement and goals, not everything will be revealed to retain a sense of menace, but the tutoial will be kept breif so as not to drain their patience and bore them.

# Requirements Outline:
 Inputs: W,A,S,D and the arrows will be incorporated for basic movements, there may also be special commands such as Shift to grab and Tab to dodge. The mouse click and Cursor will also be used.
 Processing: The Program will check for hits, calculating the position of the player if it is not hit, and update the total Game score accordingly.
 Outputs:The Game will display the player's sprite, score and position, it might also include a pop-up message when an object is encountered.
 Transmission: The amount of obstacles you evade each hold different scores, the smaller ones are faster and award more points, the biger ones with slower speeds, award less points. These will be sent to a live feed as an Output so they can constantly see 
 Storage:These points will be updated to their own high score, to improve themselves. Online Leaderboards, may give unrealistic expectations to  casual players which will make them play the game more, affecting health and vision, therfore you will only see your own scores.
 
 # Functional Requirments
1.  W or the top arrow key will make the Sprite move forward, the S or bottom arrow  will make them move behind, A and D and the two arrows will make them move side to side. The shift could be grab a powerup or let go of a handicap. The Tab button will make the Sprite engage in evasive maneouvers and the mouse click could be used in a reaction time minigame.
2. They can move the Charecter, they can pick up power-ups, look at their current score and all time high-score and dodge the pollution(Obstacles) If the game must be paused, you press the save button which records,
3. After finished playing they can save this session's scores.

# Non-Functional Requirements
1. The experience should be seamless, , it should not have glitches and be able to run the game at the highest graphic and frames possible to reduce strain on eyes.
2. The waiting time should be quite less preferrably below 5 seconds, as attention spans are a problem for this generation, and watching short form content while waiting for the game to load is terrible for brain health.
3. There will be a short tutorial at the beginning, but it will be concise and leave a few features for discovery, to retain interest.
4. The game will be available on Mobile and Laptop, on mobile there will be the gyro feature as well as touch control, on laptops, you can use WASD or the arrow keys. The other special feautures will pop up on screen for Mobile and will be the Shift key and Tab on Laptop.
5. The game should be able to scale to include additional levels without impacting performance too greatly. It should also allow more than one user so the word can be spread and freinds can bond over it.
6.All user data will be encrypted and stored securely to ensure privacy.
7. The game should be as reactive as possible, so it can pick up on the slightest motion. This will improve timing and hand eye co-ordination. It should also be available for majority of the time and downtime should be kept to a minimum

# Social and Ethical Issues:
Equity:  The term “equity” refers to fairness and justice and is distinguished from equality: Whereas equality means providing the same to all, equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances.
Accessibility: Accessibility is the practice of making information, activities, and/or environments sensible, meaningful, and usable for as many people as possible. A common example of accessibility that we have all likely encountered, is in the context of architectural design.

# Accessibility:
## Consideration: 
We want our game to be accsessible to everyone and still be enjoyable by all, we will have to edit and add many features but are prepared to do this as, Overfishing and Sea pollution are important and we should be aware of that. If someone disabled would want to play it, there will be exceptions and the games could be made easier or slower-paced. Furthermore the game is quite straightforward could also easily understood why someone with mental issues.

## Guidance: 
For people hard of hearing, this wouldn't be a concern as this game dosen't incorporate audio. If someone is blind it may be very tough for them to enjoy the game, but there will be a voiceover version, which will tell you what side the pollution is coming on, each level would also finish faster and be easier for blind people. For cases more severe than these such as mental illnesses or paralysation, alternate controls could be arranged but still may be an inconvenience for them, if it is even slightly uncomfortable we will prohibit it as we wouldn't want their conditions worsening, or hindering the healing process.

# Privacy and Data Protection
## Consideration:
My Game will collect their scores, and load their high scores everytime they re-open the game, so they can always compete with the best version of themselves. My game may also connect their cosmetic choices, so it can be automatically loaded in next time. In my game the main character will be a fish, and maybe the fish could be customizable. E.G changing a clown fish main charecter to a salmon.

## Guidance:
Before they start their first round on our game we will ask if they want to have high scores recorded overtime or just in each session, we will also ask for their starting cosmetic choice. If they elect to have the High score stored, we will encrypt it and store it on a stable server, if not, each session their high score would start and 0 and gradually go up, untill at their next session again it starts at 0.

# Fairness and Representation
## Consideration: 
My game is fully in the sea and there will be pieces of unbranded generic discarded rubbish drifting past, fishes would be the only customizeable features in the whole game. To prevent any racial stereotypes the game will not have an in-game map so no one can generalise the rubbish to a certain part of the world. 
## Guidance
As previously mentioned, humans will not be featured in this game, the only living thing is a fish, and they are customizeable, but offer no competitive advantage as they will not change speed or size, only looks. There will also be no biases as rubbish does not hold any cultural significance and cannot be judged against, as the point system is based off size.

# Mental and Emotional Well-Being
## Consideration:
The most it could do is make them aware of Sea pollution and what fishes and sea creatures have to go through everyday for survival, hopefully this will encourage them to take some action about it. It could also make them feel bad about their previous negligence to a serious issue and what it has caused in the world. 

## Guidance:
The only violence is when the fish collides with the rubbish and dies. The death animation will be a red stained fading but will not show blood or anything disturbing. When the levels get harder, the obstacles may be turtles stuck in rubbish where the mission is to release them by pressing a sequence of buttons, but this will be a very hard level to get to.

# Cultural sensitivities
## Consideration:
No, the only thing shown is the ocean, sea creatures and rubbish. If any fish or sea creatures is sacred to any culture it will not be included, and would be replaced by a different fish. In the case of rubbish, there will be soda cans, chip packets and plastic items, no brand names will be shown and any recognizable colours will be avoided.

## Guidance:
Just in case, and words or symbols are offensive to other nations or can be misunderstood, they will be blurred out, the only thing you will se on garbage is a colour and a faint residual of text or symbols. Since the sea can vary colours it will be the generic ocean, a hue between dark and light blue like shown in cartoons.
