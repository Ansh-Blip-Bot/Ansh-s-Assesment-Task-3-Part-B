Sea pollution game?  Overfishing game?  Global Warming game?  Climate change game?  Sea rising game? 
The Need for my game: A fun way for teens and young adults to find out about major Global Issues while also enhancing motor skills and Hand-eye co-ordination.
Problem statement: Young Adults are getting increasingly unknowledgeable about the current Global Circumstances and must be given this information in an intruiging way, while also enhancing basic skills.
My skills: I have a basic knowledge of Unity after making my Spongebob game and have lots of resources at my fingertips, such as Learn.Unity.com and the guidance of my teacher. The culmination of these skills will hopefully amount to a succsess without sacrificing any key features. I will also watch Unity tutorials and watch step-by-step youtube tutorials.

# Identifying and Defining
Identifying the need: My new game will create a hands-on experience where they must complete the objective in as little time as possilbe. It is personalised to all genders, teens and young adults, mixing satire with real global issues. My game will improve reaction time and timing by engaging hand eye co-ordination to acheive the goal. There will also be tutorials to explain the the movement and goals, not everything will be revealed to retain a sense of menace, but the tutoial will be kept breif so as not to drain their patience and bore them.

# Requirements Outline:
 Inputs: W,A,S,D and the arrows will be incorporated for basic movements, there may also be special commands such as Shift to grab and Tab to dodge. The mouse click and Cursor will also be used.
 Processing: The Program will check for hits, calculating the position of the player if it is not hit, and update the total Game score accordingly.
 Outputs:The Game will display the player's sprite, score and position, it might also include a pop-up message when an object is encountered.
 Transmission: The amount of obstacles you evade each hold different scores, the smaller ones are faster and award more points, the biger ones with slower speeds, award less points. These will be sent to a live feed as an Output so they can constantly see 
 Storage:These points will be updated to their own high score, to improve themselves. Online Leaderboards, may give unrealistic expectations to  casual players which will make them play the game more, affecting health and vision, therfore you will only see your own scores.

# Social and Ethical Issues:
Equity:  The term “equity” refers to fairness and justice and is distinguished from equality: Whereas equality means providing the same to all, equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances.
Accessibility: Accessibility is the practice of making information, activities, and/or environments sensible, meaningful, and usable for as many people as possible. A common example of accessibility that we have all likely encountered, is in the context of architectural design.
